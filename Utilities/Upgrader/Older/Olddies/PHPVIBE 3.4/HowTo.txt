Hello!
Thank you for purchasing phpVibe!

In order to install the CMS you will need to upload the content of the folder "CMS" to your web folder (in most cases it's called "public_html").
IMPORTANT: Make sure the .htaccess file gets uploaded correctly and overwrites the default one on server, else all links will return not found.

All simple steps: 

- edit vibe_config.php and add you own database details, site adress, license key.
- upload everything from "CMS" 
- head to /setup (and from here everything is onscreen)
- follow any requested write permissions printed by setup (try chmod 0777)
- add the admin user
- add execute permissions (via chmod) for cron.php file

Once completed (you see this info in setup as well):
- remove both /setup and a file called "hold" in root.
- login to site
- admin panel is at /moderator (you can rename it and redefine it in config).

If you have any problems please e-mail us at office@phpvibe.com

Note: This info file it's just temporary, we will release a full documentation asap! 

Thank you for understanding and please any errors you find or inconveniences.

Good luck creating the perfect video website!
