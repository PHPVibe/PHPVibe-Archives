# PHPVibe’s (also called MediaVibe CMS) road so far
##At first (end of the year 2008)
this video script started as a simple and private YouTube API CMS.
We’ve started developing for our own private use and it did the job, taking advantage of the newly released API of Youtube and Google’s ‘child days’ it was generating a constantly increasing revenue.

It developed in a free video script
one year later when ‘duplicated content’ websites were already on Google’s ‘wanted list’.

## The ‘VideoScript’ period
On the launch of the video cms the chosen domain was videoscript.net (we don’t own it anymore!).
The script was free and it served to build a video website depending 100% on YouTube videos (YouTube API based).
What happened around this period is the interest-driven, low back then, but existing.
People came with ideas, with requests and the forum for this product started buzzing life every day.

## ZubeeTube (2009)
was the next step in VideoScript’s development. Zubee Tube modified the way the script works, by allowing a more steady import of Youtube video to the owner’s video website. No longer auto-filling the website with video on visitor’s search. The cms was getting a first ADMINISTRATION and management plan.
As normal, with the high request for features came the price, and the project turned into a full product, no longer a free video script, but cheap back then (around 15$ and also cheap in features).
However, the interest kept growing…also the needs of the clients or simple visitors who had or wanted to buy the cms.

## PHPVibe 1 (end of 2010)
The first complete remake of Zubee Tube.
A full remake of the platform into a product and the new name that stuck with this project: PHPVibe!
Was still heavily dependent on the Youtube API but was more and more administrable and making the first step to a featured video platform.


As the changelog stated:

Added in v 2.1.2: - niche opportunity - featured videos - channels - admin easy import to channels - playlists - local search(optional) and many more fresh features! 
Added in v 2.1.1: 
- Admin mass import (per Youtube keyword/feed) - Dynamic homepage - Switch between SQL storage and Youtube API (no database) - Youtube Suggestions - Footer based on the famous Sherpa navigation - Many more!
Fixed : 
- Mysql load & hanging processes 
Improved : 
- New design 
- New thumb generator 
What we didn’t know back then, was how close we are to understanding the market’s needs and ready to answer them.

## PHPVibe 2.5 (end of 2011)
A step further to what was about to come, and a first step into mobile videos.

##PHPVibe 3.1 (early 2012)
The first true feature full video cms we have released!
Version 3 (3.0 and 3.1) where an extreme makeover in both looks and functionality.

PHPVibe was no longer cheap, no longer a ‘simple video script’, and was taking the step to professional video cms.

People were buying it, people were talking about it nicely everywhere!

And most important about it: this had video uploads and video sources for manual embeds.

## PHPVibe 3.3 (end of 2012 / early 2013)
The success of the CMS came on us like rain, but it was no longer a ‘wow’ feeling, we felt more the cold rain.
The cms so far depended on a cms framework called Mokoala in the admin which started crashing under the heavy features.
Now this was no longer the way to go. We had to rebuild it, we had to write our own system, no longer depending on other’s developer’s work and no longer costing us an extended license.
We did it after 2 months of solid work (let’s translate that to 24/7).
Version 3.3 of the PHPVibe video cms was an entirely new code, and a new platform, a new cms.
This time, it started to feel more like WordPress in the code (a CMS we depended on heavily during that period as part of our web development services).

It was a good release taking things ever further, with subscriptions and a tone of features people were only seeing on YouTube’s platform.


## PHPVibe 3.4 (midd-2013)
A few more steps for the CMS in the modern and professional direction.

Tons of features are being added and improved with every upgrade and path.

Constantly improving and optimizing both functionality and design.
